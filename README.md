## What is a Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.[**Flask**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework))
